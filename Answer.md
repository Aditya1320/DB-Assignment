Question 1:

The relationship between the "Product" and "Product_Category" entities is a one-to-many relationship, where one product can belong to multiple categories, and each category can have multiple products associated with it.

In the schema:
- The "Product" table contains a foreign key `category_id` that references the primary key `id` in the "Product_Category" table. This foreign key establishes the relationship between the two tables.
- Each row in the "Product" table represents a product, and each product is associated with a single category based on the value of the `category_id` foreign key.
- The "Product_Category" table contains multiple rows, each representing a category. Each category can have multiple products associated with it, as indicated by the foreign key relationship.

Therefore, for each product in the "Product" table, there is a corresponding category in the "Product_Category" table, and each category can be associated with multiple products. This relationship allows for categorizing products and organizing them into different categories.


Question 2:

To ensure that each product in the "Product" table has a valid category assigned to it, you can utilize referential integrity constraints in the database schema. Specifically, you can define a foreign key constraint on the `category_id` column in the "Product" table, referencing the primary key `id` column in the "Product_Category" table. This foreign key constraint will enforce that every value in the `category_id` column of the "Product" table must exist in the `id` column of the "Product_Category" table.

Here's an example of how you can define such a foreign key constraint in SQL:

```sql
ALTER TABLE Product
ADD CONSTRAINT fk_product_category
FOREIGN KEY (category_id)
REFERENCES Product_Category(id);
